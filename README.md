__Assignment description:__

Given two strings of length at most 100, compute the minimum number of single symbol insertions, deletions, and substitutions to transform one string into the other one.

Edit distance has many applications in computational biology, natural language processing, spell checking, etc. For example, biologists often analyze edit distances when they search for disease-causing mutations.

If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and wonâ€™t do you any good. Plus, once you've worked your heart out and are able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you've gained from such experience is priceless :)
