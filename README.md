__Assignment description:__

Given two strings of length at most 100, compute the minimum number of single symbol insertions, deletions, and substitutions to transform one string into the other one.

Edit distance has many applications in computational biology, natural language processing, spell checking, etc. For example, biologists often analyze edit distances when they search for disease-causing mutations.
