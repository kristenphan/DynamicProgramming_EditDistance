# Dynamic Programming: Comput Edit Distance
https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/

__Assignment description:__
<br/>
Given two strings of length at most 100, compute the minimum number of single symbol insertions, deletions, and substitutions to transform one string into the other one.
<br/>
Edit distance has many applications in computational biology, natural language processing, spell checking, etc. For example, biologists often analyze edit distances when they search for disease-causing mutations.
<br/>

__Problem Description__
<br/>

__Task.__ The goal of this problem is to implement the algorithm for computing the edit distance between two
strings.
<br/>

__Input Format.__
<br/>
Each of the two lines of the input contains a string consisting of lower case latin letters.
<br/>

__Constraints.__
The length of both strings is at least 1 and at most 100.
<br/>

__Output Format.__
Output the edit distance between the given two strings.
<br/>

__Sample 1.__
<br/>
Input:
<br/>
ab
<br/>
ab
<br/>
Output:
<br/>
0
<br/>

__Sample 2.__
<br/>
Input:
<br/>
short
<br/>
ports
<br/>
Output:
<br/>
3
<br/>
An alignment of total cost 3:
<br/>
s h o r t −
